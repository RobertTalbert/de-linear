This repository contains documents for **MTH 302: Linear Algebra and Differential Equations**, a four-credit course taught at Grand Valley State University by me, [Robert Talbert](http://rtalbert.org).

The main document here is the syllabus, [found here](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/linalg-diffeq/blob/473a802003c0741f639844541e733244ad0bc108/course-docs/mth302-w23-syllabus.md) (in the /course-docs directory). 

During active semesters, this repo will be added to on a regular basis. (Haha, see what I did there?)
