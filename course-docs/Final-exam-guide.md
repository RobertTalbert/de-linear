# MTH 302 Final Exam Guide 

## About the final exam 

The final exam in MTH 302 takes place on: 

- **Section 03:** Thursday, April 27 from 2:00-3:50pm ET in Eberhard Center 710
- **Section 04:** Tuesday, April 25 from 4:00-5:50pm ET in Eberhard Center 515 (note the different location) 

The exam is a 100-point timed exam. You are allowed to use a **scientific or graphing calculator** and a **3 by 5 inch notecard** on the exam, but **no computers or cell phones are allowed**. You are responsible for bringing these; loaner calculators are available from the Math Department but I (Talbert) will need a few days' notice in order to get them. There are no limitations on what you put on your notecard, and of course you can use both sides of it. 


## Exam format 

The exam will be done on paper, so also bring something with which to write. Blank paper for scratch work is OK to bring. 

The items on the exam will vary in style. You may see: 

- *Multiple choice items that assess conceptual understanding*. These would be similar to polling questions we have done in class and Math Review questions from Class Preps. 
- *Short computatons that assess basic mechanics*. These would be similar (not necessarily identical) to problems you've worked on skill quizzes. 
- *Simple applications that assess both concepts and mechanics as well as your ability to transfer knowledge to a new situation.* These would be similar to, but on a smaller scale than, your Application/Analysis questions and Miniprojects. Example: Explain why a certain given (and simple) differential equation models a physical system, then solve it using algebraic techniques. 

There will probably also be a few items at the end of the exam asking you to reflect and comment on your experiences in the course. 


## Exam coverage

The exam is **comprehensive but with an emphasis on later content in the course, namely: systems of differential equations and higher-order DEs**. 

Here is a specific list of topics that you can expect to see, in some form or combination, on the exam. Please note: It's possible some topics here could be combined in a single problem. 

Also please note, since computers are not allowed on the exam, the results of any computation that requires a computer will be given to you. However, some computations may still need to be done by hand. Those are indicated below with the label "**BY HAND**". Computations that are to be done by hand will be kept simple. 

- Linear algebra
  - Convert a system of linear equations into an augmented matrix. 
  - identify whether an augmented matrix for a system is in reduced row echelon form (RREF). If it is, state whether there are zero, one, or infinitely many solutions and then find those solutions. If it isn't, perform a series of row operations to get it into RREF. (You should prepare to do RREF computations **BY HAND** if they are simple, for example on a $2 \times 3$ matrix.)
  - **BY HAND**: Multiply a vector to a matrix. 
  - Determine whether a given vector is in the span of a collection of other vectors.
  - Determine if a set of vectors (possibly containing three or more vectors) is linearly dependent or linearly independent.  
  - Determine if a set of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ spans all of $\mathbb{R}^n$. 
  - **BY HAND**: Add, subtract, and multiply two matrices that have compatible sizes; if the sizes aren't compatible, say so and explain why. 
  - Determine if a square matrix is invertible. 
  - **BY HAND**: Compute the determinant of a $2 \times 2$ matrix. 
  - **BY HAND**: Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a $2 \times 2$ matrix. 
- Differential equations
  - Identify the *order* of a differential equation. 
  - Find the equilibrium solutions of a differential equation. 
  - **BY HAND**: Check whether a given function is or is not a solution to a differential equation and/or an initial-value problem. 
  - Match a group of differential equations to the correct slope fields. 
  - **BY HAND**: Solve a homogeneous first-order DE or IVP using integration (or the "shortcut" approach given by Theorem 2.3.1).
  - **BY HAND**: Solve a separable first-order DE or IVP using integration. 
  - **BY HAND**: Solve a non-homogeneous first-order DE or IVP using integration (via the method of integrating factors). 
  - **BY HAND**: Determine whether a DE is exact or not. (But, you won't be asked to solve it.) 
  - Set up and solve (potentially **BY HAND**) applications of DE's involving mixing problems, exponential growth, and population dynamics. 
  - **BY HAND**: Given an IVP, provide 2-4 steps of an approximate solution using Euler's Method. 
- Systems of Differential Equations
  - Given a direction field and a collection of systems of DE's, match the direction field to the correct system. 
  - Convert a system of linear first-order DE's into matrix form. 
  - **BY HAND**: Check whether a given vector function (or pair of scalar functions) is or is not a solution to a system of differential equations. 
  - Given a system of linear, homogeneous first-order DE's and the eigenvalue/eigenvector pairs of its matrix (and assuming the eigenvalues are real, distinct, and nonzero): 
    - State the straight-line solutions
    - State the general solution
    - **BY HAND**: Find the particular solution given an initial condition. 
  - Given a linear homogeneous system of first-order DE's that has complex eigenvalues, find its general solution. 
  - Set up and solve (potentially **BY HAND**) applications of DE's involving mixing problems and population dynamics. 
  - Find all equilibrium solutions for a system of linear, homogeneous differential equations and (given the eigenvalue/eigenvector pairs) classify those equilibria. 
- Higher-order differential equations
  - Given a second-order linear, homogeneous differential equation: 
    - Find its characteristic polynomial
    - **BY HAND**: Find its characteristic roots (For the exam, these will be set up so the roots are always real)
    - State its general solution
    - Find the particular solution to an initial value problem


## How the final exam works in the course grade

Your course grade is primarily determined by the grade table in the syllabus by doing Successful work on regular course assignments. As mentioned in the syllabus, the exam modifies this basic grade: 

- A score of 85% or higher on the exam will add a "plus" to the grade coming from the table in the syllabus; and
- A score of 50% or lower on the exam will add a "minus" to the grade coming from the table. 

A score between 50% and 85% will result in no change to the grade coming from the table. 

## How to prepare for the final exam

**In short: Practice.** Don't simply "review the notes"; *practice* by getting your hands on actual work that requires you to do something. Suggestions: 

1. Practice by re-doing older WeBWorK sets. These should still be available to review, although the grading is closed. 
2. Practice by doing Practice Set 13 which is due on Sunday, April 16. 
3. Practice by working through old Application/Analysis sets, which are still posted on Blackboard. Check your own work using a computer tool (although of course computers are not allowed on the exam). 
4. Practice by re-doing your work on Miniprojects, or working on Miniprojects whose initial due date has passed. Especially, revising Miniprojects that need revision anyway is good practice and it needs to be done anyway. 
5. Practice by reviewing PollEverywhere polls which you can find in the slides on the Resource Page. 
6. Practice by working through examples and exercises from the textbook. 
7. Practice by making up flash cards for important terms, then quiz yourself over the definitions and try to build examples or non-examples of each. 
8. Practice **BY HAND** computations by making up randomized examples using SymPy, then work them out by hand, then check your work on the computer. 

Then when it's time for the exam, just do it like you practiced.
