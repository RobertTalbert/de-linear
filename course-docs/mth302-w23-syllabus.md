## About the instructor 

I'm Robert Talbert, the professor for this course. I'm a Professor of Mathematics and also work in the president's office as Presidential Fellow for the Advancement of Learning. This is my 31st year of teaching overall (not counting tutoring gigs). I have a Ph.D. in Mathematics from [Vanderbilt University](http://vanderbilt.edu) and a B.S. degree from [Tennessee Tech University](http://www.tntech.edu). 

I was, at best, a thoroughly mediocre math student in school until my senior year of high school, when I had a teacher for Calculus (hi, Mrs. Allen) who stopped trying to cram things into my head and instead showed me the basics -- and then backed off, and let me work things out on my own (with support if I got stuck). Basically, this is how I teach today. 

After a two-year gig as a Psychology major in college, I changed my major to math after a late-night dare from my roommate (long story) and, to my great surprise, I fell in love with the subject. I ended up getting a Ph.D. working in an obscure area at the intersection of abstract algebra and geometry, and I also discovered I loved teaching math to college students. So I went on to spend 14 years teaching in [small liberal arts colleges](http://franklincollege.edu) before coming to GVSU in 2011.

Now, I teach computer scientists and engineers how to think like mathematicians, I do research on how to make college teaching better, and I coordinate large-scale teaching/learning projects for President Mantella's office. (The fancy active learning classroom in which we are meeting, is one of my projects.) When nobody is looking, I am working on my skills in Python and R, learning data science, and dabbling in project management. 

I live in Allendale with my wife, two teenage kids (there's another kid who lives in Greenville), and three cats. I'm a long-time bass guitar player and a lover of the outdoors. I aspire to spend more time in a kayak or on a bike than in front of a computer. You can read more about what I'm thinking and doing at my website, [rtalbert.org](https://rtalbert.org), or at my "other blog" [Grading for Growth](https://gradingforgrowth.com) about alternative grading practices which I co-author with my GVSU colleague Prof. David Clark. I'm also on Twitter at [@RobertTalbert](http://twitter.com/RobertTalbert) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roberttalbert/). I will accept any connection request on LinkedIn from a student!
