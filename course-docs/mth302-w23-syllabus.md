## About MTH 302 and this syllabus

**Welcome to MTH 302!** I'm Dr. Robert Talbert, the professor of this course. I'm grateful you're here, and I think you're going to love what you learn this semester. 

MTH 302 about **modeling and understanding systems undergoing change.** A car driving down a bumpy road is such a system, as it its shock absorbers encounter and smooth out the bumps. So is an ecosystem where one species preys upon another and the populations change dynamically. So is an electric circuit with a resistor and power supply; or two guitar strings vibrating next to each other at different frequencies; and many other systems we encounter every day. 

In MTH 302 we model and understand these systems using two fundamental tools: 

- **Linear algebra**, the study of systems of linear equations and their solutions; and 
- **Differential equations**, which studies equations that connect the current state of a quantity to its rates of change. 

Both tool sets are foundational in their own right; but as we will see, they can also mutually support each other in interesting and useful ways. 

**This syllabus contains all the information you need to navigate the course.** The main document will be kept continuously up to date at this link. When you see blue- or purple-underlined text in the syllabus or any other document, it's a clickable link. For example, [click here for a cat video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFuUidBR1aQ). A PDF version of the syllabus will also be available on Blackboard in the *Syllabus and Calendar* area, but it will not be updated unless there is a major change. 

**This document is meant to be read once, then searched as needed.** If you need to find something, the easiest way is to pull up the document, hit `Control-F` and then do a search for the text you're looking for.

- **Course calendar:** The official course calendar is in Appendix B and on Blackboard. *In case of a date conflict on assignments or course documents, the Class Calendar is assumed to be correct.* 
- **Definition of "week":** In our course, a "week" is defined to begin at 12:01am ET on *Monday* and end at 11:59pm ET the following *Sunday*. 
- **Blackboard and announcements:** Our Blackboard page is at https://lms.gvsu.edu. Announcements will be posted on Sundays, with occasional mid-week announcements. *Be sure to check announcements, email, and the calendar at least once daily.*
- **Textbook:** *Differential Equations with Linear Algebra* by Boelkins, Goldberg, and Potter. It is freely available online through the GVSU Library; [click here to access](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.ezproxy.gvsu.edu/lib/GVSU/detail.action?docID=472100). **I recommend you download individual PDFs of the chapters so you can use them offline.** We will be working through most of Chapters 1--5. 

**Course tools:** We will use computer tools extensively in the course. In addition to Blackboard, these include: 

- **Perusall** (http://perusall.com): An online tool for collaborative reading and viewing. 
- **Python**: A widely-used and easy to learn programming environment. We will not be doing much actual programming in the course, but instead using two packages for doing math: **SymPy** (a package for doing symbolic math) and **NumPy** (for numerical analysis). 
- **Jupyter notebooks** via **Google Colab** (http://colab.research.google.com): Jupyter is an open-source graphical notebook interface for working with Python. Colab is a Google product for working with Jupyter notebooks, that lives in the cloud and can be connected to your GVSU Google Drive. 
- **Miro**: An online whiteboard tool for presentations and collaborative work. We'll use it in class from time to time. 

We'll get fluent with all of these tools during the first week of class using some custom tutorial videos I have made.

## About the instructor 

I'm Robert Talbert, the professor for this course. I'm a Professor of Mathematics and also work in the president's office as Presidential Fellow for the Advancement of Learning. This is my 31st year of teaching overall (not counting tutoring gigs). I have a Ph.D. in Mathematics from [Vanderbilt University](http://vanderbilt.edu) and a B.S. degree from [Tennessee Tech University](http://www.tntech.edu). 

I was, at best, a thoroughly mediocre math student in school until my senior year of high school, when I had a teacher for Calculus (hi, Mrs. Allen) who stopped trying to cram things into my head and instead showed me the basics -- and then backed off, and let me work things out on my own (with support if I got stuck). Basically, this is how I teach today. 

After a two-year gig as a Psychology major in college, I changed my major to math after a late-night dare from my roommate (long story) and, to my great surprise, I fell in love with the subject. I ended up getting a Ph.D. working in an obscure area at the intersection of abstract algebra and geometry, and I also discovered I loved teaching math to college students. So I went on to spend 14 years teaching in [small liberal arts colleges](http://franklincollege.edu) before coming to GVSU in 2011.

Now, I teach computer scientists and engineers how to think like mathematicians, I do research on how to make college teaching better, and I coordinate large-scale teaching/learning projects for President Mantella's office. (The fancy active learning classroom in which we are meeting, is one of my projects.) When nobody is looking, I am working on my skills in Python and R, learning data science, and dabbling in project management. 

I live in Allendale with my wife, two teenage kids (there's another kid who lives in Greenville), and three cats. I'm a long-time bass guitar player and a lover of the outdoors. I aspire to spend more time in a kayak or on a bike than in front of a computer. You can read more about what I'm thinking and doing at my website, [rtalbert.org](https://rtalbert.org), or at my "other blog" [Grading for Growth](https://gradingforgrowth.com) about alternative grading practices which I co-author with my GVSU colleague Prof. David Clark. I'm also on Twitter at [@RobertTalbert](http://twitter.com/RobertTalbert) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roberttalbert/). I will accept any connection request on LinkedIn from a student!
