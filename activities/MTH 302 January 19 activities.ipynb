    "1. Solve each of the following systems using matrices. This means: Convert each one to its augmented matrix; get the matrix into RREF; then determine if the system is consistent or inconsistent. If consistent with one solution, state what the solution is. If consistent with infinitely many solutions, identify the free variable(s) and then give a relationship between the pivot variables and the free variables. \n",

    "2. In statistical analysis, we sometimes want to find a curve that passes through a given set of points to model a data set. Suppose we have three $xy$-pairs: $(1,4), (2,7)$, and $(3,6)$. These three points don't lie on the same *line*, but we might be able to find a *curve* that goes through them. Is it possible to find a parabola, graphed by the function $f(t) = at^2 + bt + c$, that goes through all three of these points? If so, what are the values of $a,b,c$ that make this work? (Hint: If the graph of $f(t)$ goes through the point $(1,4)$, it means that $f(1) = 4$, and therefore $4 = a \\cdot 1^2 + b \\cdot 1 + c$. Can you use this idea and the rest of the information here to make a linear system?)\n",

If it can be, then find weights on $\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ that create the linear combination. If not, explain why. "
