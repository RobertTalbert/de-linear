    "- Download this notebook from the Resource Page and open it in Colab. \n",
    "- Work on the following exercises in your groups. Be sure to stay active, ask for help, and give help. \n",
    "- If you get stuck, try to work it out with your team. You can ask questions at any time, but try to power through the difficulty yourself first. \n",
    "- Some items are designated \"**★AA**\". These will be collected as part of **Application/Analysis 1** which is due on Wednesday, January 25. None of the other items will be turned in, but you will need to work on the *entire* activity here to understand the parts that *are* turned in. \n",
    "- You may use technology if you want, unless it says otherwise. \n",
    "- We will review as many of the items that are *not* on on Application/Analysis 1, as we have time for. \n",

Find a set of three nonzero vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that cannot possibly produce the vector $\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} 20 \\\\ 23 \\end{bmatrix}$ as a linear combination of those three. Explain why your example works. Also, what vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ *can* be produced as a linear combination of those three? \n",

(**★AA**) In Calculus 3 and physics we sometimes talk about three special 3D vectors: $\\mathbf{i} =  \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, $\\mathbf{j} =  \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$,  and $\\mathbf{k} =  \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. These vectors are special because **every vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is a linear combination of these three**. Explain why that statement is true. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. (**★AA**) Is it true that if you take *any* three vectors from $\\mathbb{R}^3$, that every vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ will be a linear combination of these? If so, explain why using a general argument and not specific examples (because specific examples don't explain why a statement is \"always\" true). If not, give an example where you choose a set of three specific vectors from  $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and a fourth vector that cannot be a linear combination of the first three. (Compare with what you did above.) "
