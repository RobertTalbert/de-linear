# MTH 302: Linear Algebra and Differential Equations

## Activities for Tuesday March 21

1. **(AA 8)** Find the general solution for the system

$$\dfrac{dx}{dt} = 5y, \dfrac{dy}{dt} =  -2x$$

2. Find the particular solution to the above system if $x(0) = 1$ and $y(0) = 4$. 

3. Earlier in the course we looked at a mass-spring system that led to a second-order differential equation: 

   $$y'' + y' + 6y = 0$$

   where $y$ represents the distance of the mass from its natural resting position, as a function of time. Convert this into a system of two first-order equations. (Hint: Let $u = y'$ and then the system will involve $dy/dt$ and $du/dt$.) Then find a formula for $y$ as a function of $t$ given that $y(0) = 1$.
