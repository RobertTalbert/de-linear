## Example
Tickets to a basketball game are 25 for kids and 50 for adults. At one of the games, 2000 people attend and the total gate revenue is $70,000. 

**How many kids attended, and how many adults?** 
:::

Let $x$ be the number of children attending and $y$ the number of adults. Write **two equations** that represent the two pieces of info in the second sentence. 

---

$$\begin{align*}
x + y &= 2000 \\
25x + 50y &= 70000
\end{align*}$$

## Linear equation
A *linear equation in $n$ variables* is an equation that looks like this:

$a_1 x_1 + a_2x_2 + \cdots + a_n x_n = b$ 

Left side is nothing but variables multiplied by numbers and then added together. Nothing else is done to the variables. 
:::

---

$$\begin{align*}
x + y &= 2000 \\
25x + 50y &= 70000
\end{align*}$$

:::{.callout-note}
## System of equations
A **system of $m$ linear equations in $n$ unknowns** (or an "$m \times n$ system") is a collection of $m$ linear equations with $n$ variables. A **solution** to a system is a list of specific values for the variables that makes all the equations in the system true at the same time. 
:::

A $3 \times 5$ linear system: 
$$\begin{align*}
2x_1 + 3x_2 - x_4 + 3x_5 &= 10 \\
x_2 + x_4 &= 1 \\
-x_1 + 3x_2 + 5x_3 + 2x_4 - 100x_5 &= 0 
\end{align*}$$

$$\begin{align*}
x + y &= 2000 \\
25x + 50y &= 70000
\end{align*}$$

## Activity

Using whatever means you can think of, determine if this $2 \times 2$ system has a solution. If it doesn't have a solution, be ready to explain why. If it does have a solution, figure out *how many* it has, and what it is/they are. 
:::

---

## There are basically three ways to find solutions to a system 

You can **graph** the equations and see if their graphs intersect. This works OK for systems with two variables: 

```{python}
from sympy import *
x, y = symbols('x y')
p1 = plot(2000 - x, (x,-10,2000), show = False)
p2 = plot((70000-25*x)/50, (x, -10, 2000), show = False)
p1.append(p2[0])
p1
p1.show()
```

---

...but for three variables, it gets weird: 

$$\begin{align*}
x + y + z &= 3 \\   
y - z &= 2 \\ 
2x + y + z &= 4 
\end{align*}$$

```{python}
from sympy.plotting import plot3d
x,y,z = symbols('x y z')
p1 = plot3d(3 - x - y, (x,-5,5), (y,-5,5), show=False)
p2 = plot3d(y - 2, (x,-5,5), (y,-5,5), show=False)
p3 = plot3d(4 - 2*x - y, (x,-5,5), (y,-5,5), show=False)
p1.append(p2[0])
p1.append(p3[0])
p1
p1.show()
```

## But graphical intuition is very important for us

Since solutions to systems are intersections of lines or planes (ir higher-dimensional versions of these): 

- A solution might have solutions (the system is **consistent**), or it might have none (it's **inconsistent**)
- A consistent system can have either **exactly one** solution, or **infinitely many solutions**, but nothing in between. 

[Check this out](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/wrajgsvua6)

---

Example of a *consistent* system with *exactly one* solution: 
$$\begin{align*}
x + y &= 2 \\
x - y &= 0
\end{align*}$$

Example of a *consistent* system with *infinitely many* solutions: 
$$\begin{align*}
x + y &= 2 \\
3x + 3y &= 6
\end{align*}$$

Example of an *inconsistent* system: 
$$\begin{align*}
x + y &= 2 \\
x + y &= 0
\end{align*}$$

---

Back to solution methods: You could also **substitute** - Pick an equation, solve for a variable, plug in to the other equations, and repeat until you have values. Tedious but doable for 2 or 3 variables. 

But this? No thanks: 
$$\begin{align*}
2x_1 + 3x_2 - x_4 + 3x_5 &= 10 \\
x_2 + x_4 &= 1 \\
-x_1 + 3x_2 + 5x_3 + 2x_4 - 100x_5 &= 0 
\end{align*}$$

--- 

The best option is **elimination**. Works by performing a combination of three *elementary operations*: 

1. *Replace* a row, with the sum of itself and a multiple of another row. 
2. *Swap* any two rows. 
3. *Scale* a row by multiplying both sides by a nonzero constant. 

Each operation produces a system that is **equivalent** to the original one (it has the same solutions). 

At the board: how this works. 

---

$\begin{align*}
x + y &= 3 \\ 
y - z &= 2 \\ 
2x + y + z &= 4 
\end{align*}$ 
$\Longrightarrow$
$\begin{align*}
x + z &= 1 \\ 
y - z &= 2 \\ 
0 &= 0
\end{align*}$

```{python}
from sympy.plotting import plot3d
x,y,z = symbols('x y z')
p1 = plot3d(3 - x - y, (x,-5,5), (y,-5,5), show=False)
p2 = plot3d(y - 2, (x,-5,5), (y,-5,5), show=False)
p1.append(p2[0])
p1
p1.show()
```

## KEY INSIGHT
The variables in the elimination process don't matter that much. They are just there as placeholders for the coefficients. So forget them and put the coefficients and right-hand sides into an array called the **augmented matrix** for the system. 
:::

$$\begin{align*}
x + y + z &= 3 \\   
y - z &= 2 \\ 
2x + y + z &= 4 
\end{align*}$$

$$\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & 3 \\ 
0 & 1 & -1 & 2 \\ 
2 & 1 & 1 & 4
\end{bmatrix}$$
Now you can do elimination just with the matrix. (Board) 

---

$$\begin{equation*}
\begin{alignedat}{4}
x &  {}+{}  & 2y &  &  &  {}={}  & 4 \\
2x &  {}+{}  & y &  {}-{}  & 3z &  {}={}  & 11 \\
-3x &  {}-{}  & 2y &  {}+{}  & z &  {}={}  & -10 \\
\end{alignedat}
\end{equation*}$$

## Activity
Convert this system into an augmented matrix. Then use a sequence of the three elementary operations to try to find a solution (there may not be one). 
:::

---

```{python}
from sympy import * 
init_printing()
M = Matrix(3,4, [1,2,0,4,2,1,-3,11, -3, -2, 1, -10])
M.rref(pivots = False)
```

This matrix is in **reduced row echelon form (RREF)**: 

- If there are any rows that are all zero, they are at the bottom. 
- The first nonzero entry in a given row is $1$, and it's in a column that's to the right of the first nonzero entry in any row above it. 
- Every other entry in a column with a leading $1$ is $0$. 

---

Consistent with one solution: 
$$\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 2 \\
0 & 1 & -5 
\end{bmatrix}$$ 

Consistent with infinitely many solutions: 
$$\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 2 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & -1 & -5  
\end{bmatrix}$$ 

Inconsistent: 
$$\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & -5 
\end{bmatrix}$$ 

--- 

$$\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 2 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & -1 & -5  
\end{bmatrix}$$ 

Is shorthand for the system 
$$\begin{align*}
x_1 + 2x_3 &= 1 \\  
x_2 - x_3 &= -5
\end{align*}$$
To find a solution: Pick anything for $x_3$. Then $x_1 = 1 - 2x_3$ and $x_2 = x_3 - 5$. 

- $x_3$ is a **free variable**
- $x_1$ and $x_2$ are **pivots** or sometimes "determined" or "dependent" variables

## More facts about RREF

- The process of putting a matrix into RREF is called **Gauss-Jordan elimination** and it's kind of a big deal
- *Skill LA.1: I can solve a system of linear equations by converting it into an augmented matrix and putting into reduced row echelon form*. Coming next Thursday on Skill Quiz 1 and in Practice Set 1. 
- **But this is the only place you will be asked to do elimination by hand!** In all other situations you will use a computer. 
- So don't stress over doing RREF by hand, just practice until you can do it on simple systems without a bunch of mistakes. $\rightarrow$ **Optional RREF Practice set on WeBWorK**

Solve this system using matrices. If there are no solutions, say so and explain how you know (using a matrix).
