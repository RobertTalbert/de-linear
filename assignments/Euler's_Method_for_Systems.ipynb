So instead, engineers and others who use systems of DEs opt for **numerical solutions**, where instead of a formula for $x(t)$ and $y(t)$, we generate a table of approximate outputs for $x$ and $y$ as time varies. \n",

To use Euler's Method, we need a first-order DE $\\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t,y)$, an initial condition $y(t_0) = y_0$, and a step size $h$. The method proceeds by starting at the point $(t_0, y_0)$ and then stepping $h$ units along the tangent line at this point, which has slope $f(t_0, y_0)$. This gets us to a new point $(t_1, y_1)$ whose coordinates are \n",
